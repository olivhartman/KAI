File1 is the Sony A7SIII + 35mm lens setup for her live stream, we will call it  "live-streaming-camera'. the measurement of the camera body (A7S III): 13cm x 10cm.
Lens (35mm Prime): 10cm length.
Total Rig Length: ~25cm (10 inches) including the mount.
Mount Height: The center of the lens is positioned 122cm (48 inches) from the floor. 75cm (desk) + 47cm (pole) = 122cm. This aligns perfectly with the eye-level of KAI


To maintain perfect consistency in Kling 3.0 and Nano Banana, we need to lock in these specific "Real-World" measurements. These numbers are calibrated for KAI’s height (**172cm**) and the standard **8ft (244cm)** ceiling of a 1970s Orange County home.

### **The "BOXBOX Studio" Blueprint**

#### **1. The Desk (White Minimalist)**
*   **Width:** **140cm (55 inches).** (Wide enough for dual 24-inch monitors with a small gap).
*   **Depth:** **60cm (24 inches).** (Standard depth for a bedroom desk; places the camera roughly 70cm from KAI's face).
*   **Height:** **75cm (29.5 inches).** (The universal standard for ergonomic desks).

#### **2. The White Leather Executive Chair**
*   **Total Height:** **120cm (47 inches).** (The top of the headrest will be just above KAI’s ears when she sits).
*   **Seat Height:** **48cm (19 inches).** (Standard height for a 172cm person to have their feet flat on the floor).
*   **Width:** **65cm (25.5 inches).** (The chrome armrests provide a sleek, wide frame for her hips/shoulders).

#### **3. The Sony "Live-Streaming-Camera" Rig**
*   **Body (A7S III):** **13cm x 10cm.**
*   **Lens (35mm Prime):** **10cm length.**
*   **Total Rig Length:** **~25cm (10 inches)** including the mount.
*   **Mount Height:** The center of the lens is positioned **122cm (48 inches)** from the floor. 
    *   *Logic:* 75cm (desk) + 47cm (pole) = 122cm. This aligns perfectly with the eye-level of a 172cm woman sitting upright.

#### **4. The Bed (Queen Size, Low-Profile)**
*   **Width:** **152cm (60 inches).** (A standard Queen-size bed fits the "Fashion Influencer" lifestyle).
*   **Length:** **203cm (80 inches).**
*   **Height:** **55cm (21.5 inches).** (Includes the low platform frame and mattress. Staying low makes the 8ft room feel taller/more spacious).

### **The Spatial "Math" (Why this works)**
In your images, the "Aisle" (the space between the desk and the bed) is approximately **150cm (5 feet)** wide. 
*   **The Math:** 150cm (Aisle) - 65cm (Chair width) = **85cm of open floor.**
*   **The Result:** This gives KAI plenty of room to "pull back" the chair 50cm and do a full 180-degree swivel without hitting the bed.

### **Final Prompt to get the "KAI in the Seat" Shot**
*Use these measurements to tell Nano Banana exactly how to frame her.*

> "A professional 4K photo taken through the **live-streaming-camera (Sony A7S III)**. **@KAI (172cm tall)** is sitting in the **white leather executive chair (120cm tall)** at her **140cm wide white desk**. 
>
> **Framing:** Medium close-up. Her eyes are perfectly level with the lens. She is leaning slightly forward, her forearms resting on the pink desk mat. She is wearing the red 'BOXBOX' tank top. 
>
> **Scale & Depth:** Behind her, the **Queen-size bed (152cm wide)** is visible in the background, softly blurred by the **35mm f/1.4 bokeh**. The pink LED backlight (75cm from the floor) glows behind her shoulders. The 1:18 scale F1 cars on the shelves (180cm from the floor) are visible but blurred. Everything is in perfect real-world proportion. Photorealistic, high-fashion aesthetic, 8k."

**Does this set of measurements feel right to you?** 
If so, this "Scale Data" should be added to your Kling 3.0 Element description to ensure she never looks too big or too small for her furniture.
